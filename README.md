Battleship game written in Python 3 with Tkinter GUI

Play the battleship game vs. the computer taking turns.  The GUI makes playing the game easy.
The player must set up his / her board with their chosen ship placement.  
The placement of ships on the computer's board is randomly generated.

Issues:
1. There is currently no intelligence behind the moves made by the computer.  It is random.  I plan to change this.
**IN PROCESS**2. Test cases will be added to several function calls, and many of these functions will then be refactored, and easily tested.
3. The code will be cleaned up a bit more, according to DRY and OOP principles, and more comments will be added.
4. Upon completing a game, the initalization of a new game needs to be cleaned up, some one time calls are unnecessarily called again.
5. Statistics - wins, losses, ties will be added.  This will be saved to a text file in json format, and imported at the program start.
**FIXED**6. A problem whereby the player can overlap ships on their board must be fixed.  This will begin with adding unit tests, checking the board to ensure that it is valid.
